## What?

A **podcast**.

About _what_ exactly? – Pretty much any field from the social to the natural sciences, history to the arts. If it's something we can discuss to understand ourselves and the people and world around us a little more, we'll probably talk about it some point.

## Why?

### Curiosity: Everything is interesting if you give it a chance.

We often find ourselves unwilling to learn more about a given topic if we can't see the value in learning about it, or if we have never encountered it before. However, if something is is interesting to someone, there must be a reason for it – it is undoubtedly worth at least trying to understand better, and in doing so may give your own beliefs and interests more context/new perspectives. Hopefully we can put this into practice and explore new topics and spark people's interest in topics that they wouldn't otherwise be exposed to.

### Variety: Anti-hyperspecialisation.

There currently seems to be a big push towards people trying to get to the top of their niche that they work, study or live in. Whilst we think that hyperspecialisation has its benefits, we feel that the majority of us can benefit by making our rabbit holes of specialisation slightly less deep, but far more broad. It's a lot easier to become relatively well versed in a new topic, than become the best in a topic you're already good at.

> The more we broaden our knowledge set, the better we can understand the intrinsic value of, and the relationship between, different fields of academia and thereby our understanding of the people and world around us.

We aim to deliberately challenge ourselves in these episodes by choosing to explore new topics in order to better understand aspects of life we would usually not be otherwise exposed to.

### Discipline.

An element of discipline is usually required in order to _get_ a topic to the point where it becomes an enjoyable practice.  
By posting our conversations to the public domain, we are committing ourselves to express our thoughts and ideas with more scrutiny. Not only will this develop our own thinking and understanding, but also help us become better at expressing and communicating these thoughts to people from all sorts of backgrounds.

Noticed that we made some major mistakes about anything in particular? Have opposing views/ideas from what you heard us talk about, or have a different perspective? Thought we didn't do a particular topic justice? Then we want you to let us know/hold us accountable so that we may learn, improve, and be less ignorant for next time. This gives the aspect of discipline a new dimension for us.

There is a lot of satisfaction that can be acquired from the process of improvement in something – a sense of achievement is valuable: adding variety to your interests by maintaining a curious mindset requires a level of discipline within your mentality and approach to life in general, but being disciplined with it can bring clear reward and we feel is a worthy investment.

## Who

### Subaan Qasim

<HostCard hostData={props.subaanData} />

**Age:** 24 years.  
**Location:** London.  
**Occupation:** 5th Year Medical Student.

**Summary:**  
I'm a 5th year medical student, motion designer and self-taught software engineer. Currently, I'm taking a break from my medical studies to explore opportunities in the tech industry, particularly MedTech, whilst also delving into the realm of data science.

I've been researching in the field of nutritional and lifestyle intervention in the treatment of metabolic diseases, and improving health in general, for the past 6 years – this is something I wish to continue after graduation.

I also have a background in the creative industry, namely video editing, motion design and photography. I have many years of experience freelancing and teaching these domains. I mostly use the entire Adobe Creative Suite, in particular After Effects, Premiere Pro, Audition and Lightroom. Design-wise, I'm currently spending my time with UI/UX design to harmonise my software development with my motion design background to deliver refreshing micro-animations to the frontend.

Science, tech, lifestyle design and my religion of Islam is where my heart lies. Learning and having conversation about anything that furthers my knowledge in those areas is something I can do endlessly, in the hope that I can better understand myself and those around me.

### Daniel Redfearn

<HostCard hostData={props.danData} />

**Age:** 23 years.  
**Location:** London.  
**Occupation:** 6th Year Medical Student.

**Summary:**

I'm a final-year medical student at King's College London (KCL) with interests in languages, geopolitics, music, and sports.

Within medicine, I'm most interested in congenital heart defects. This began as a patient myself, finding out I had a congenital heart defect after two collapses in sport settings and undergoing subsequent open heart surgery. Since completing an Intercalated BSc in Cardiovascular Sciences at Imperial College London in 2020, I continue to try and be involved in the field in various capacities, with the aim of one day working in paediatric cardiology.

Outside of my studies, I really enjoy language learning. I started learning Spanish and French around 10 years ago, and began learning Portuguese at around 15 years old, in order to communicate with my Portuguese Mum's family. More recently, I began teaching myself Mandarin Chinese. This has been fascinating and challenging – I am currently at around HSK 3/4, and I've learned a lot about myself through this process. I love the different perspectives language learning has given me. There are so many parts of the world I want to understand better, and I understand that learning foreign languages is a key that can unlock these doors. I look forward to hopefully being able to maintain this interest for many years.

Sport and music are two other areas of enjoyment. I'm involved in the tennis club at KCL where I'm very proud to serve as President, and I've loved piano since starting lessons at three years old! It's a great way to express thought and emotion.

I'm lucky to be able to explore my passions and to have a network facilitating this – something which not everyone has access to. I want to continue to better understand the world around me, and appreciate that a level of open-mindedness and willingness to learn is needed for this. This will be a lifelong journey, but I've learned over time to not focus on the end-goal and instead to enjoy the process. By sitting down with Subaan and guests, I'm able to learn from others through meaningful conversation. Making these conversations public will hopefully extend this curiosity and interests with our audience, with the end-goal of 'getting' the world around us a little better.
